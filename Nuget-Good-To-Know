Prerequisites
The .NET Core SDK, which provides the dotnet command-line tool. Starting in Visual Studio 2017, the dotnet CLI automatically installs with all .NET and .NET Core related workloads.
Install or update a package
The dotnet add package command adds a package reference to the project file, and then runs dotnet restore to install the package.

Open a command line and switch to the directory that contains your project file.

Use the following command to install a NuGet package:

.NET CLI

Copy
dotnet add package <PACKAGE_NAME>
For example, to install the Newtonsoft.Json package, use the following command

.NET CLI

Copy
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
After the command completes, you can open the project file to see the package reference.

For example, open the .csproj file to see the added Newtonsoft.Json package reference:

XML

Copy
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.1" />
</ItemGroup>
Install a specific version of a package
The dotnet add package command installs the latest version of the package unless you specify a different version.

To install a specific version of a NuGet package, use the optional -v or --version switch:

.NET CLI

Copy
dotnet add package <PACKAGE_NAME> -v <VERSION>
For example, to add version 12.0.1 of the Newtonsoft.Json package, use this command:

.NET CLI

Copy
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json --version 12.0.1
List package references
List the package references and versions for your project by using the dotnet list package command:

.NET CLI

Copy
dotnet list package
Remove a package
Use the dotnet remove package command to remove a package reference from the project file.

.NET CLI

Copy
dotnet remove package <PACKAGE_NAME>
For example, to remove the Newtonsoft.Json package, use the following command:

.NET CLI

Copy
dotnet remove package Newtonsoft.Json
Restore packages
The dotnet restore command restores packages that the project file lists with <PackageReference>. For more information, see PackageReference in project files.

.NET Core 2.0 and later dotnet build and dotnet run commands restore packages automatically. As of NuGet 4.0, dotnet restore runs the same code as nuget restore.

To restore a package with dotnet restore:

Open a command line and switch to the directory that contains your project file.
Run dotnet restore.
